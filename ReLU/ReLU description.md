# Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) Activation Function

## Overview
The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is a type of activation function used in artificial neural networks. It is one of the most widely used activation functions due to its simplicity and effectiveness. ReLU replaces all negative values in the input with zero, while leaving positive values unchanged.

## Function
The ReLU function is defined as follows:


f(x) = max(0, x)

## Characteristics
- **Range**: The output of the ReLU function is in the range [0, +âˆž).
- **Simplicity**: ReLU is a simple piecewise linear function, which makes it computationally efficient to compute and differentiate.
- **Sparsity**: ReLU can induce sparsity in the network by setting a portion of the activations to zero, which can help with regularization and reducing overfitting.
- **Non-linearity**: Although ReLU is linear for positive values of \( x \), it introduces non-linearity to the network, enabling it to learn complex relationships in the data.

## Usage
ReLU activation function is commonly used in hidden layers of neural networks, especially in deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep feedforward networks (DNNs). It is particularly effective in models dealing with image data and other high-dimensional data.

## Advantages
- **Efficiency**: ReLU is computationally efficient to compute and differentiate, making it suitable for large-scale neural network architectures.
- **Sparse Activation**: ReLU can induce sparsity in the network, reducing the computational load and memory requirements.
- **Non-saturation**: ReLU does not saturate for positive inputs, unlike some other activation functions like sigmoid and tanh, which helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.

## Limitations
- **Dead Neurons**: Neurons activated by ReLU can sometimes become "dead" (i.e., they always output zero), which can slow down or halt the training process. This usually happens when the learning rate is too high or due to initialization issues.
- **Not Zero-Centered**: ReLU outputs are not zero-centered, which can lead to issues with optimization in some cases.

## Implementation
ReLU activation function can be easily implemented in most programming languages using simple conditional statements. Here's a Python implementation:

#```python
#def relu(x):
    return max(0, x)
