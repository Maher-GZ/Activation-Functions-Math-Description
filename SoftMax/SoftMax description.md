# Softmax Activation Function

## Overview
The softmax function is a type of activation function commonly used in the output layer of neural networks for classification tasks. It transforms the raw output scores into probabilities that sum up to 1, making it suitable for multi-class classification problems.

## Function
The softmax function is defined as follows for a vector 

Exponential (current index ) /  sum( Exponential (current index ))

## Characteristics
- **Probabilistic Interpretation**: The softmax function converts raw scores into probabilities, allowing the model to output a probability distribution over multiple classes.
- **Normalization**: The output of the softmax function is normalized, ensuring that the sum of probabilities across all classes equals 1.
- **Monotonicity**: Softmax is a monotonic function, meaning that higher input values will result in higher probabilities for the corresponding classes.

## Usage
Softmax activation function is commonly used in the output layer of neural networks for multi-class classification tasks, where each class is mutually exclusive. It is often paired with the categorical cross-entropy loss function during training.

## Advantages
- **Interpretability**: Softmax outputs can be interpreted as class probabilities, making it easier to understand the model's predictions.
- **Gradient Preservation**: Softmax function maintains the gradients during backpropagation, facilitating efficient training using gradient-based optimization algorithms.
- **Differentiable**: Softmax function is differentiable everywhere, allowing for smooth optimization during training.

## Limitations
- **Sensitivity to Large Inputs**: Softmax is sensitive to large input values, which can lead to numerical instability known as the overflow problem. This can be mitigated by using techniques like log-sum-exp trick.
- **Independence Assumption**: Softmax assumes that the classes are mutually exclusive, which may not hold true in all scenarios.

## Implementation
Softmax activation function can be easily implemented in most programming languages using their respective mathematical libraries. Here's a simple Python implementation:

```python
#import numpy as np

#def softmax(x):
#    exp_x =[]
#    soft=[]
#    for i in range(len(x)):
#        exp_x.append(np.exp(x[i]))
#    sum_exp_x = sum(exp_x)
#    for i in range(len(x)):
#        soft.append(exp_x[i] / sum_exp_x)
#    return soft
#
